# Description
This repository contains a group of exercises made for the "Introduction of Data Science" subject from University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil).

Those exercises were made and executed in Python language using the "Jupyter Notebook" framework

Each file "pratica_X" has a pdf description of what had to be made and a file with ".ipynb" extension that contains the results.

# Execution
To execute this project you have to open the ".ipynb" files with "Jupyter-Notebook"

I strongly recommend that you install jupyter-notebook with the package "Anaconda", following the steps provided by the link below:
