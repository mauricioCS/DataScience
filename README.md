# Description
This repository contains a group of exercises made for the "Introduction of Data Science" subject from University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil).

Those exercises were made and executed in Python language using the "Jupyter Notebook" framework

Each file "praticaX" has a pdf description of what had to be made and a file with ".ipynb" extension that contains the results.

* PraticaI

  Hypothesis survey, exploratory analysis, distance-based similarity measures.

* PraticaII

  Location measures (boxplot), dispersion measures (interval and variance), distribution measures (statistical moments, histogram), multivariate data.

* PraticaIII

  Data summarization and graphical visualization (histogram, pie chart, scatter plot, etc.)

* PraticaIV

  Pre-processing, data quality, data cleaning (missing values, disposal, imputation), inconsistent values, redundant objects, noise and outliers.

* PrativaV

  Unbalanced data, data transformation (qualitative to quantitative and vice versa), attribute transformations.

* PrativaVI

  Sampling (hold-out, resampling), assessment measures II (accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, F-Measure, etc.), ROC curve, hypothesis test.

* PraticaVII

  Distance-based learning, distance measurements (similarity and dissimilarity), KNN.

# Execution
To execute this project you have to open the ".ipynb" files with "Jupyter-Notebook"

I strongly recommend that you install jupyter-notebook with the package "Anaconda", following the steps provided by the link below:
